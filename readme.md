# Lalalab Project

## Part 1:

Create a web app which displays "Hello Lalalab !" with a simple html file.
Via a GitHub Action, build a docker image and push it on a docker registry.
NB: I use GCP Container Registry.

## Part 2:

Via Terraform, create a web server to host the docker image created in Part 1.
Give it a public end point.
NB: I use GCP Cloud Run.
